# docker-debian10-nginx-lua-script
The project is a Docker container based on Debian 10, with NGINX installed and LUA.  The container will execute a shell script that outputs the STDOUT to a FILE.  The content of this file is returned by NGINX.  - I should find a better name for the image, I know. - This container is an experiment for exposing the results of ansible-inventory commands in a later stage.
